# armvirtualNetwork
Azure Resource Manager template for deploying two virtual networks across the following EU regions:

  - West Europe
  - North Europe
 
The template can be used to deploy a LAB-like environment for learning, testing and evaluation purposes. The template, uses a multi-tiered network zone model to ISOLATE and SEGMENT services across functional boundaries, each of which are protected by a Network Security Group at the Subnet Level. 

The template is highly customisable and can be used to build and generate similar network patterns within an Azure Subscription.
