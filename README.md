# armvirtualNetwork
Azure Resource Manager template for deploying two virtual networks across the following EU regions:

  - West Europe
  - North Europe
 
The template can be used to deploy a LAB-like environment for learning, testing and evaluation purposes. The template, uses a multi-tiered network zone model to ISOLATE and SEGMENT services across functional boundaries, each of which are protected by a Network Security Group at the Subnet Level. 

The template is highly customisable and can be used to build and generate similar network patterns within an Azure Subscription and of course can be expanded to support your unique use cases. The fictitious Litware Inc company, naming conventions and IP schemas can be changed to better reflect your context and as such are not dependancies for success.
